# openGLRace
In this application, I just use openGl and glut library. I train OOP approach.

The application consits of three parts
1. In ferst, you can create and save 2D car model from simple figure: Rectangle, Triangle and Cycle. Also, you can select color.
2. You can select model from existing car models

3. Here locate one level. Level consist of three parts. In first, generats red rectangles - move in a straight line with different speed.
In second part, add white triangles - move up-down and in a straight line with different speed.
In third, add yellow cycles - move at an angle and bounce off edges with different speed.
